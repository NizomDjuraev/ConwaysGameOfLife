# ConwaysGameOfLife

Implemented Conway's Game of Life using the default rules. 
There are five buttons:
1. Step: Steps through each board state
2. Go: Starts the interval and lets the board run continously
3. Pause: Pauses the board state
4. Reset: Resets the board state to the beginning board
5. Random: Generates a random board
